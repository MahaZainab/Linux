# Linux Beginner Guide (For Windows Users)

This guide is for beginners who are familiar with **Windows** but new to
the **Linux operating system**.
Its purpose is to introduce some basic Linux commands that are very
useful in computer science and software development.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Why Learn Linux?

Linux is widely used in: - Servers and cloud computing
- Software development
- Artificial intelligence and data science
- Cybersecurity

Learning Linux commands will give you more control over your computer
and make you comfortable in environments used by professionals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Using Command Line on Windows

Even if you don't have Linux installed, you can start practicing basic
commands on **Windows Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**.

### How to open Command Prompt:

1.  Press **Windows + R**.
2.  Type `cmd` in the text box.
3.  Press **Enter**.

This will open the Command Prompt window. You can also search for
**PowerShell** in the Start menu and use it instead.

## 3. Running Linux on Windows

For deeper practice, you can install and run Linux alongside Windows in
different ways: - **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** -- Allows you to
run Linux directly inside Windows.
- **Virtual Machine** -- Install software like VirtualBox or VMware and
run Linux as a virtual system.
- **Dual Boot** -- Install both Windows and Linux on your computer (more
advanced).

If you're just starting, **WSL** is the easiest way.

## 4. Basic Linux Commands to Try

Here are some simple commands (they also work in Command
Prompt/PowerShell with slight differences):

-   `pwd` → Print the current directory (folder).
-   `ls` → List files in the directory.
-   `cd foldername` → Change directory.
-   `mkdir newfolder` → Create a new folder.
-   `rm filename` → Delete a file.
-   `cp file1 file2` → Copy a file.
-   `mv oldname newname` → Move or rename a file.
-   `clear` → Clear the screen.
-   `exit` → Close the terminal session.
